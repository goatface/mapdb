# mapdb
Kaldonis-moderated mapdb only touched by bona fide map editors.

Trying to keep this as up-to-date and figure out the best method.

Latest changes include:
1) Updated Cysaegir graphics, new Stables room, supernode tags, bar RP entry fixed.
2) Updated Halcyon Hills graphics, added new rooms
3) All the Beacon Hall lockers and tags that were missing
4) All public rooms on gswiki that are supernodes are now tagged
5) All rooms on Western Dragonspine had check_location turned off
6) A couple paths around IMT/Pinefar now have adjectives to avoid warcamps
7) IMT public lockers can now ;go2 from town, etc
